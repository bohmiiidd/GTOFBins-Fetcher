## Usage

### Check a single binary

To check suite of binaries, use the `--bin` option followed by the binary name (e.g., `find,base64,vim`):

```bash
python3 GTOFBins.py --bin find
```

### Check multiple binaries from a file

To check multiple binaries listed in a file, use the `--file` option:

```bash
python3 GTOFBins.py --file binaries.txt
```

Where `binaries.txt` is a text file containing a list of binaries (one per line).
